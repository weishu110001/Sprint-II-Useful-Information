I found these videos to be very helpful when it comes to the concept of developing a level. Understand where to place sprites for ach level is import to knowing how to be
user friendly when it comes to how well each platform affects how you play as a user. I highly recommend coming out with an idead to what you want to be building first, and than think 
of a level design.
